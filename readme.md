# HTML5 Video Player

## H2 P2019 - Web development
The goal is to make a video player in ~1 week, with the classic characteristics of HTML5 video controls (play/pause, volume control, fullscreen, etc.) plus any bonus functionality I can think of.
The player must be compatible with every HTML5-ready web browser.

## My take on the subject
I tried to make a player as simple as possible, with self-explanatory code and
discreet animations.  

## Features
- Controls bar: appears by default, when the video plays is disappears and reappear on video hovering.
- Play/pause button + clicking anywhere on the video triggers the same function as clicking on the button
- Volume button: clicking mutes/unmutes the video
- Volume slider: more precise control over volume.
- Fullscreen button: Sets the player fullscreen, can't do a more obvious description
---
Roadmap :
- Have custom controls on fullscreen, instead of default browser controls
- Tune the timeline to have a cursor and some "wave" animation going on
- Keyboard shortcuts : spacebar for play/pause, f for fs, 1-9 for fast-forward shortcuts, etc.
